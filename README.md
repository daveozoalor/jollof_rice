# The Jollof rice 

A Namibian, A Nigerian, a Senegalese and a South African have a discussion

The Nambian to the Nigerian: I really like the Jollof rice.

The Nigerian: I will cook you some 

Then the Senegalese start explaining that the Jolof rice in fact originate from Senegal as it was the name of an old senegalese empire.

They start arguing and the south African go like: "Well, if the Jollof rice comes from Senegal and the Nigerian copied it and adapted it then it must be open source!"
